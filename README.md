PROJECT SCOPE

The purpose of the TCP: GIVE  website is to turn visitors into donators. 

It was important to us to identify our target audience, speak to their need to want to help and give them a clear action plan to make a donation. 

We created a colorful, fun and easy way to encourage donating during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
